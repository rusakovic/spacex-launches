# Task
## SpaceX Launches
You will be building a simple React Native application that will connect to the open source SpaceX API and display
listings of the launches they have upcoming and completed.
For the data, you may use the following APIs. They do not require any special authentication. You can use the
following documentation listed under “Launches”:
https://docs.spacexdata.com/?version=latest#bc65ba60-decf-4289-bb04-4ca9df01b9c1

## Task

What should you build?
Please build a simple application that has a list of upcoming launches in the future and a list of
latest launches in the past. Tapping on an item in the lists will navigate to a detail view of that
launch with more information.
Please also include additional features as you see fit (have fun!) For example: filter/search,
rocket details, images etc.
If you like it even fancier, feel free to look into the other APIs offered on the above website and
build something that includes them.
The style and interface of the app is completely up to you - however we are more looking to
see how you implement the architecture / code of the app, not style it.
